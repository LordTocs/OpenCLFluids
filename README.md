OpenCLFluids
============

Grid Fluid simulation through OpenCL and OpenGL. Contains code for grid based fluid simulation for 2D and 3D simulations.


This is the results of my final project for my Parallel Programming course.

The simulation code can be found in [FluidField2D.cpp](https://github.com/LordTocs/OpenCLFluids/blob/master/LiquidVolumeRender/FluidField2D.cpp)

The OpenCL wrapper used in the simulation is under [Components/Tocs/Parallel](https://github.com/LordTocs/OpenCLFluids/tree/master/Components/Tocs/Parallel).

No warrenty on how well this code works, it was thrown together quick and dirty.
